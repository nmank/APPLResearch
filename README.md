File Structure
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example Code
-Raw maple output for distributions with specific parameters

Example Output
-LogLogistic(1,2).pdf = pdf of raw maple output for distributions with specific parameters
-LogLogistic(1,2)_PDF.pdf = neat and presentable output for distributions with specific parameters

-other files are autogenerated backups, feel free to ignore

Example Plots
-Plots of the PDF and HF of each new distribution, divided because we had to skip functions that didn't work

General Code
-Raw maple output for general forms of distributions (just support and PDF)

General Output
-LogLogistic_Gen.pdf = pdf of raw maples output for general forms of distributions
-LogLogistic_Gen_PDF = neat and presentable output for distributions with specific parameters

Tables
-Tables summarizing the valuable qualities of each distribution
